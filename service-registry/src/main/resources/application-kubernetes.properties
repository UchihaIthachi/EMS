# This profile is active when running in Kubernetes.
# For Service Registry, its primary role is Eureka Server.
# If it also acts as a client (e.g., to config-server), this ensures Eureka client behavior is off.
eureka.client.enabled=false

# Ensure config-server is found via K8s DNS if service-registry is a client of config-server.
# This is typically handled by spring.config.import in the main application.properties or bootstrap.properties.
# No specific override needed here if the main config is already pointing to K8s DNS for config-server.
